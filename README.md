# SHOOTMovie

SHOOTMovie is a ReactJS project which lists movies, and show their respective details.

## Description

This project fetches a list of popular movies from TMDB API and shows it in the browser. It is built using ReactJS along with AntDesign UI icons at few places. I have used Redux for the state management. And, for testing the components, I have used Jest and RTL, Cypress and BackstopJs.

## Technical Overview

I have tried not remove extra dependencies for this project related to UI. At mostly all places in code, I have tried to be organic and used HTML, CSS and JS for building elements, instead of depending on the third-party libraries. Also, in the newest version, I re-designed and re-structured the project with new design and using Webpack instead of create-react-app.

I plan to add more features and UI components to this project, in the near future.
